* Local storage and session storage are browser caches where you can persist data

* Local Storage persists across browser tabs, and persists when browswer closes
* Session storage persists within a single tab in a browser

* Useful so that your front end code doesnt need to hit backend server to fetch data
* Makes apps quicker to run and reduce load on backend

* Drawback is data can become stale, not god for live data

* React query is a solution for caching data
